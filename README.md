# Project-Pandas-Kashyap_Suratia
Used advanced quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.
Created a tool (an analysis notebook) that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determined  which portfolio outperformed the others. Historical daily returns of several portfolios were provided: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represented the portfolios of famous "whale" investors , and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. 
I used this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compared its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 Index).
